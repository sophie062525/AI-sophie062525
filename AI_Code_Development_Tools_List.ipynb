        "\n",
        "**Revised Prompt:**\n",
        "\\\"Identify AI-powered code development tools or IDEs that offer features comparable to or augmenting the capabilities of a code editor like VS Code. For each tool, provide:\n",
        "1.  **Title:** The official name of the tool.\n",
        "2.  **Description:** A brief overview highlighting its AI capabilities and developer benefits.\n",
        "3.  **Primary AI Functionality:** The core AI feature(s) (e.g., code completion, generation, analysis, refactoring).\n",
        "4.  **Integration/Platform:** How and where it's used (e.g., IDE extension, standalone IDE, cloud service).\n",
        "5.  **Official Link:** A URL to the tool's official website or main repository.\n",
        "6.  **Key Considerations:** Relevant details such as pricing, target audience, or notable limitations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Present this information clearly in a markdown list. After providing the list, explain the rationale behind this revised prompt's structure and wording, and conclude with relevant follow-up questions.\\\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**Reasons for Modification:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Clarity on \\\"Like VS Code\\\":** The original prompt's use of \\\"like VS Code\\\" was ambiguous. VS Code is primarily an editor enhanced by extensions. The revised prompt clarifies this by asking for tools that either *augment* existing editors (like VS Code extensions) or are *standalone AI-powered IDEs*, thus broadening the scope appropriately.\n",
        "2.  **Structured Information Fields:**\n",
        "    *   The original field \\\"ref\\\" was unclear in its purpose. It has been replaced by more specific fields: **\\\"Primary AI Functionality\\\"** (what the AI does) and **\\\"Integration/Platform\\\"** (how/where it works). This provides more actionable detail.\n",
        "    *   \\\"Comments\\\" was very general. **\\\"Key Considerations\\\"** guides the response to include more pertinent information like cost, user focus, and potential downsides, making the list more useful for evaluation.\n",
        "3.  **Improved Actionability:** The revised prompt uses clearer action verbs (\\\"Identify,\\\" \\\"Provide\\\") and numbered points for the required information, making the request more precise and easier for an AI to fulfill accurately.\n",
        "4.  **Output Format Refinement:** While maintaining the requested markdown list format, specifying the exact fields to be included in each list item ensures consistency and better organization of the data.\n",
